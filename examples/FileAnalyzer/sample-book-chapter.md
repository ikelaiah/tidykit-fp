# The Whispering Woods

## Chapter 1: The Mysterious Letter

It was a chilly autumn morning when Eliza found the letter on her doorstep. The envelope was sealed with deep green wax, stamped with a symbol she didn't recognize—a twisting vine encircling a crescent moon. Her nam2e was written in elegant, looping script: **Eliza Thornwood**.

Curiosity piqued, Eliza broke the seal and unfolded the parchment inside. The message was brief:

> "Meet me at the old willow tree by dusk. Come alone.  
> —A Friend"

## Chapter 2: Into the Woods

Despite her better judgment, Eliza couldn’t resist the pull of the unknown. As the sun dipped below the horizon, she wrapped a scarf around her neck and made her way toward the woods at the edge of town. The trees loomed tall and silent, their leaves whispering secrets to the wind.

At the heart of the woods stood the ancient willow, its branches trailing like curtains. Eliza hesitated, then stepped forward.

A figure emerged from the shadows—a young man with silver hair and eyes the color of storm clouds. He smiled, though there was sadness in his gaze.

“You came,” he said softly. “Thank you.”

Eliza’s heart pounded. “Who are you?”

He looked up at the moon. “My name is Rowan. And I need your help to save the Whispering Woods.”
